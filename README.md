# love2d-topdown-project

### About
A personal project written in Lua using LOVE2D, created in early 2019 when I began to teach myself programming. Was originally supposed to implement movement for a topdown RPG. Will be fixed and updated regularly to track my own learning progress. One day, it might even become a game.

### Libraries
This project makes use of the following:
- [hump](https://github.com/vrld/hump) for OOP and camera
- [Simple Tiled Implementation](https://github.com/Karai17/Simple-Tiled-Implementation) for maps
- [anim8](https://github.com/kikito/anim8) for animations
