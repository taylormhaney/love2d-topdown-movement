# love2d-topdown-movement
 
A personal project written in Lua using LOVE2D, created in early 2019 when I began to teach myself programming. Was originally supposed to implement movement for a topdown RPG. 
At the time of writing, this contains extremely buggy and unorganized code. Will be fixed and updated regularly to track my own learning progress. One day, it might even become a game.
Placeholder "player" image came from this tutorial: https://love2d.org/wiki/Tutorial:Baseline_2D_Platformer
All other images, such as the placeholder grass tile, were made by me.
